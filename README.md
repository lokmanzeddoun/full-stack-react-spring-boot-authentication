# Authentication Web App with React Frontend and Spring Boot Backend

This repository contains the code for an authentication web application. The frontend is built using React, while the backend is implemented using Spring Boot. The repository is organized into two separate folders: `frontend` for the frontend application and `backend` for the backend application.

## Prerequisites

Before running the application, ensure you have the following software installed on your system:

- Node.js
- npm (Node Package Manager)
- Java Development Kit (JDK)
- Maven

## Getting Started

To run the application, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

    ```bash
    git clone <repository_url>
    ```

2. Navigate to the `frontend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd frontend
    ```

3. Install dependencies:

    ```bash
    npm install
    ```

4. Start the frontend application:

    ```bash
    npm run start
    ```

5. Open another terminal window and navigate to the `backend` directory:

    ```bash
    cd ../backend
    ```

6. Build the backend application:

    ```bash
    mvn clean install
    ```

7. Run the backend application:

    ```bash
    ./mvnw spring-boot:run
    ```

Replace `<repository_url>` with the URL of your repository, and `<backend_jar_file_name>` with the name of your backend JAR file generated by Maven.

## Usage

Once both the frontend and backend applications are running, you can access the authentication web app by opening your web browser and navigating to `http://localhost:3000`.
